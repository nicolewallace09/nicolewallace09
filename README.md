Languages: JavaScript (AJAX, JSON), HTML, CSS, SQL
Frameworks & Libraries: React (Hook, Redux), Vue, jQuery, Bootstrap, Materialize,  Node.js  (Express.js, Inquirer.js, File System, Sequelize), Handlebars.js, Recharts.js, GraphQL/Apollo

‚ú® Some fun things about me:
* I'm a dog lover (sorry cat people)
