I am Full Stack Software Engineer in the SF Bay Area with a Bachelor’s Degree and 2+ years professional experience in Business Administration combined with 3 Liberal Arts Associate’s Degrees in Arts and Sciences. I am a naturally curious person which makes me want to always learn new things, a problem-solver who questions everything, and a hard worker who doesn't take life too seriously and enjoys the little things.

✨ Some fun things about me:
* I'm a dog lover (sorry cat people)
* I love hiking and rollerskating (I'm not good at rollerskating though) 
* I'm into all things Disney
* I'm a movie enthusiast, especially horror and thillers
* My weakness is ice cream
