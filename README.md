### Hello World, I'm Nicole! 👋 Nice to virtually meet you! 🙂

I am Full Stack Software Engineer in the SF Bay Area with a Bachelor’s Degree and 2+ years professional experience in Business Administration combined with 3 Liberal Arts Associate’s Degrees in Arts and Sciences. I am a naturally curious person which makes me want to always learn new things, a problem-solver who questions everything, and a hard worker who doesn't take life too seriously and enjoys the little things.

💻 My tech stack<br>

Languages: JavaScript (AJAX, JSON), HTML, CSS, SQL
Frameworks & Libraries: React (Hook, Redux), Vue, jQuery, Bootstrap, Materialize,  Node.js  (Express.js, Inquirer.js, File System, Sequelize), Handlebars.js, Recharts.js, GraphQL/Apollo
Tools:  MongoDB, MySQL, Sqlite3, Git, GitHub, Command Line, Heroku, Jest, VSCode 

✨ Some fun things about me:
* I'm a dog lover 
* I love hiking and rollerskating 
* I'm into all things Disney
* I'm a movie enthusiast, especially horror and thillers
* My weakness is ice cream
